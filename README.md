# Java Learning Journey (Beginner to DSA)

This repository documents my journey learning Java, starting from the basics and progressing towards Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I will be pushing all the Java programs I write during this learning process to this repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to reflect the learning progression. Here's a general overview:

*   **`Basics/`**: Contains fundamental Java concepts like:
    *   Data Types
    *   Variables
    *   Operators
    *   Control Flow (if/else, loops)
    *   Input/Output
*   **`ObjectOrientedProgramming/`**: Covers Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:
    *   Classes and Objects
    *   Inheritance
    *   Polymorphism
    *   Abstraction
    *   Encapsulation
*   **`DataStructures/`**: Implements common data structures:
    *   Arrays
    *   Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
    *   Stacks
    *   Queues
    *   Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
    *   Graphs
    *   Hash Tables
*   **`Algorithms/`**: Implements various algorithms:
    *   Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
    *   Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
    *   Graph Algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
    *   Dynamic Programming
    *   Greedy Algorithms
*   **`Projects/`**: Small projects to apply learned concepts.

*(This structure may evolve as I progress through the learning process.)*
